# Hw outline

** Your program should be capable of computing the following operations:

  * addition: add(n, x) = n + x
  * predecessor: pred(n) = n - 1
  * truncated subtraction: tsub(n, x) = x - n if x > n, 0 otherwise
  * multiplication: mult(n, x) = n * x
  * exponent: expo(n, x) = n^x
  * boolean signature: sig(n) = 0 is n = 0, 1 otherwise
* equality: eq(n, x) = 0 if n = x, 1 otherwise

**The program must be written in Haskell and each function can only be defined as a primitive recursive function according to the definition seen in this topic. Therefore, to define your functions (whatever is on the right-hand side of the '='), you may only use:

  * The initial primitive recursive functions
  * The primitive recursive operators
  * Previously defined primitive recursive functions
  * Each function in your program should be typed.

We should see a trace of the computational steps the program has been through (see below).
