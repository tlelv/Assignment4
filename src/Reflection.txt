In this program, we used Clojure to write arithmetic operations using only the formal definition of recursive
functions. Working as a group, the assignment had helped us learn the computational
power of recursive functions, such as addition, multiplication, subtraction and exponentials. Using only primitive
recursive functions was a challenge that we were able to overcome. Working in a group has also given us the experience
of working as a team and putting our thoughts together to create a joint project. It has also helped us better
understand GitHub.
